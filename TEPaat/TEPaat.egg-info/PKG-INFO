TEPaat
=========================

A small program that loads a data, performs dimensionality reduction and then 
predict the class of process data.

Installation
------------

``TEPaat`` was built on Sckit-learn, umap-learn, pandas and numpy framework. 
Though several parts of the notebooks uses other tools. The final package use only 
the aforemented 4 tools. To install package, do the following:

```python
# install package
pip install TEPaat
# use package
from TEPaat import TEPaat
test = TEPaat()
# load data
data = test.load_data(path_to_featuredata, no_toplabel = False) # no_toplabel = False means there is a column name
labels = test.load_data(path_to_label_data, no_toplabel = False) # please ensure that excelsheet has a column name 'label'
# predict class 
## Note that the code assumed that the labels has: {2, 3, 6, 8, 13}.
## The code has converted this labels based on our analysis that {2, 3, 6, 8, 13} is equal to {1, 3, 4, 0, 2}
predictions = test.predict(data)
accuracy = test.eval_accuracy(predictions, labels)
print(f'The performance of the model is: {accuracy}')
